# Genetic-Algorithm-based-self-evolving-Soft-robot
# Final project for Columbia University MECE 4501 Evolutonary Computation and Design Automation
# Instructor: Hod Lipson
# Project team member: Jiaqi Miao, Wanjun Chao
# The goal of this project is to design a soft robot with combination of spring and mass point.
# The soft robot should be able to move by changing the length of spring and weight of the mass.
# Key point:
# 3D physics simulator to simulate gravity force, spring tension force, ground reaction force and firction that apply on the robot.
# 3D physics simulator has both Python and C++ version.
# Genetic algorithm aim to help Robot self evolve and find the fastest robot.
# Python code is use for robot visuallization.
# C++ code is use for evolutionary algorithm. 
# The evolutionary algorithm contain three types of mutation method and two types of corssover method.
